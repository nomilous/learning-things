### Make a webapp with:

* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - because it's awesome! (And [this helps](https://rvm.io/) if you need multiple versions)
* [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) - to manage the application dependancies (gems)
* [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) - because they did it their way, and it was good. 
* [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) - to enable sprockets (and because of [THIS!](http://pow.cx/) and [THIS!](http://xip.io/))
* [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) - because it has: "...a powerful preprocessor pipeline that allows you to write assets in languages like CoffeeScript..." 
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - because it's beautiful

...allmost forgot:

* [RSpec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) - because [Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is the new [Hyperspace](https://github.com/nomilous/we-rspec/tree/master/.metadata), only better.
